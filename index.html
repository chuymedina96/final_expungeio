            <h2>More on expungement</h2>
            <p>EXPUNGEMENT is the legal process of ERASING juvenile arrests and court cases.. 
               Only a judge can order that records be expunged. Once you have your record expunged, you can lawfully say that you do not have a criminal record on applications. 
            </p>
            <p>
              If you were arrested as a juvenile, the police station and the court began creating records that are kept and maintained from the moment you were arrested. This means that you have a juvenile record, EVEN IF you were arrested and released from the police station, your case was dismissed, or you were found ‚Äúnot delinquent‚Äù/‚Äúnot guilty.‚Äù Even if you were placed on supervision or probation, you still have a juvenile record that doesn‚Äôt automatically go away.
            </p>
            <p>
              Even though juvenile records are supposed to be confidential, there many exceptions to this general rule. That means that there are a lot of people who could potentially see your record legally. <a href="http://ijjc.illinois.gov/sites/ijjc.illinois.gov/files/assets/Burdened%20for%20Life.pdf">Juvenile records are also sometimes unlawfully disclosed to employers, landlords, schools, and licensing boards.</a>

            <p>
              A juvenile record does not go away on its own, and you're better off without one. A juvenile record can be a serious barrier to a good job, housing, or academic programs. The good news: most juvenile records can be erased through a process called juvenile expungement, and as of January 1, 2017, many people can start the expungement process at ANY AGE!
            </p>
            <p>
              This is your chance to remove these barriers that are standing between you and the future you want. It‚Äôs okay if you‚Äôve made some mistakes in the past, but now is the time to move away from the past and give yourself all the opportunities you can! Having a juvenile record can make it hard to get a job, obtain credit, find a place to live, qualify for student loans, and so much more. Expunging your record makes sure that people see you for who you really are NOW, and not judge you based on past mistakes.

                        If you were arrested under age 18 or had a case in juvenile court, you have a juvenile record.  Even though a juvenile record is not the same as an adult conviction. A juvenile arrest, or a juvenile court case, can still show up on a background check, and very often, still is a barrier to things you need for your future. Remember, even arrests that never went to court create a record!

                       Your juvenile record is supposed to be confidential, but in reality, there are many legal exceptions to that protection.  Juvenile records are frequently disclosed, even when they shouldn‚Äôt be.  Even though a juvenile case is not the same as an adult case, many employers, licensing agencies, and other entities still treat it the same way they would an adult conviction.  Some are allowed by law to do so, and some do so illegally.
                       If a job application asks you about criminal convictions, you may not have to reveal your juvenile record. If you think a job has seen your juvenile record or that you have been turned down for a job because of a juvenile record, call the Juvenile Expungement Help Desk at <a href="tel:312-229-6359">312-229-6359</a> to learn more about your rights.

                        No, a juvenile record is not a criminal conviction, even if you were "found guilty" in juvenile court. In Illinois, you cannot be convicted of a crime in juvenile court, because juvenile court is separate from (adult) criminal court.

                       To start the process, it typically takes an hour or less of your time at the Juvenile Expungement Help Desk! <br><br>

                       Usually, a court date is scheduled about 45 days from the petition date. After a judge approves the petition on the court date, it takes about 2 months for the police to erase records and for the records to no longer appear on a background check. So in total, the whole process is typically over in 100 days or less. For most people, Most of this process will be handled by help desk staff, will be handled by your attorney, and many people don‚Äôt need to come back to the help deskcourt after their first visit. If you have questions about this process, call the help desk for more information!
